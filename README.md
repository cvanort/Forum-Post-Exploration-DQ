# Forum Post Exploration (Dataquest Intermediate Python)

In this project, I determine which type of Hacker News post created during which hour garners the most comments on average. You can download the source data <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts">here</a>, from Kaggle. A more detailed description is included in the jupyter notebook.</br></br>

This script was based on a Dataquest project: <a href="https://app.dataquest.io/c/62/m/356/guided-project%3A-exploring-hacker-news-posts/1/introduction">Exploring Hacker News Posts</a>. The notebook contains two scripts: one using the step-by-step instructions from Dataquest, and one using the methods I find most efficient, which in this case involved the pandas and matplotlib package.
